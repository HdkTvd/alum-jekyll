  <h2 style="text-align:center">Fr CRCE Alumni Association's Activity Report</h2>
  <p>
      The Alumni Association of Fr CRCE was formulated almost 25 years ago with the intention of promoting and fostering mutually beneficial interaction between Alumni and the Institute.Fr CRCE boasts of an illustrious Alumni culture spread across various sectors and various countries. They are the pride of the Institute and are our brand ambassadors.
  </p>
  <p>
      The activities are organised throughout the year and arranged by the Alumni Committee who work relentlessly to improve the interaction. The activities range from technical talks for students, help with placement-related activities as well as motivational talks and career counselling.
  </p>
  <p>
      An Annual Alumni Meet is conducted every year on the first Saturday of January which receives an enthusiastic response. It is a time for Alumni to come back to their Alma Mater and relive the glorious years that they spent in the Institute. From the past four years, the celebrations for the Silver Jubilee batch have been conducted at the Alumni meet. This year, the Alumni Committee launched an initiative named “Alumni Speakup” to provide a platform for inviting ex-students to deliver talks to present students on varied technical and Non-technical. This effort was appreciated by the students. AlmaConnect, an Alumni portal is available for current students, staff and alumni to connect to other alumni spread across the world. It’s a great platform to keep everyone connected and updated with latest developments in college.

      This year started with a session by our Alumni from various job profiles, as a part of the FE Induction program where they shared their journey with the students. Mr. Pascal Lopes, Batch 1999, Computers, Vice-President at J.P.Morgan, India(Robotics Technology Division), was the Guest of Honour for the Fr Conceicao Rodrigues Memorial Debate (CRMD). Mr Mihir Karkare, Batch 2007, Computers, an avid debater himself, officiated as a judge for the finals of CRMD. Several Alumni are part of the Departmental Advisory Board ( DAB) of each department and attend regular meetings in advisory capacity. They have equally participated towards knowledge sharing as Guest Speakers during various Alumni Speakup talks, seminars and workshops. A major contribution of our Alumni is towards placement assistance in various capacities like soft skills training, training in Group discussions and resume preparation,etc.

      It gives us immense pleasure to mention that Batch 1991 Production donated around 2 lakhs towards the purchase of Solidworks,3D CAD design software, analysis software, and product data management software. Besides this, the Alumni Committee arranges for yearly donations towards the student project groups participating in various National/ International competitions like Mavericks, Vayushastra, Robocon, Abadha, Avistrota  and CFR.
