We are glad to know that a good no of our ex-students involved in various activities related to the projects of CRCE.  We are also proud of our Ex-students who are doing extremely well in various walks of life chosen by the Alumni.  Like any other Institution CRCE recognizes great talents and potentiality among the students who provide excellent services in their respective carriers. All through the year we exchange ideas and views among the students who are connected to us.  We want this connect to take it to different level and so appeal to our Alumni to remain connected to the Alma Matter.  CRCE wishes to know from the Alumni the various ways and avenues by which they can enhance the teaching learning  process in the College so that right motivation and able guidance could be given to the students who are studying in their respective branches. I appeal to the Alumni to strengthen and support the ongoing student projects of great significance.

      quote: An 'alumnus' is 'the nurtured,' one who was loved, cherished and held in high regard and affection. This term 'alumnus' is therefore exactly descriptive of our feelings for our old students here at Fr. Conceicao Rordigues College of Engineering (Fr. CRCE). Every student who passes through Fr. CRCE will surely realize his / her dreams and make a positive impact on the community in particular and the world in general. An alumnus is also an asset to this institution in the sense that he/she gives something back to enrich the institution in terms of experiences shared or expertise volunteered, he or she also is an ambassador of the Fr. CRCE who disseminates the values and ideals this college stands for and propagates these values over generations by being a model to the young. Fr. CRCE believes in lifelong learning and this alumni initiative should promote many qualities such as sharing and caring, constant and periodic communication, and assistance to the Alma mater all over the globe as required. Students who graduate from Fr. CRCE could greatly contribute to the welfare of the Alma mater through constant communication and periodic update of the work done by the alumni. Fr. CRCE will be privileged to know the progress of all the students after leaving college and this portal will be a great platform to share ideas as well as learn about the progress made by other alumni. Connecting to one's alma mater is always a great feeling and the college shares this sentiment and is elated when it gets to know about the various achievements of its former students after leaving college. This initiative also provides alumni with opportunities for volunteering through our association; career and profession related networking events, as well as access to college seminars, workshops and other interactive programs. We welcome all Alumni to become a member of FR. CRCE Alma mater We look forward to your contribution to make this alumni association a great success.
